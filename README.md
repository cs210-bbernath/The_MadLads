# The_MadLads

This is the repository of project 1 for the Machine Learning Course at EPFL (CS-433).\
The project 1 was done by the team 'The MadLads' composed of Bastien Bernath, Etienne Boisson and Xavier Theimer-Lienhard.\
The project 1 consisted of using regression methods to classify a dataset from the CERN challenge ([AICrowd challenge](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/epfl-machine-learning-higgs)) into Boson and non-Boson.

To reproduce our results:
- clone the repository and add the data folder from the AICrowd challenge into the directory of the repository
- run the run.py file to reproduce our results, this python file outputs submission files that you can submit on the AICrowd challenge
- use the jupyter notebooks to reproduce our cross validation for the hyper-parameters
